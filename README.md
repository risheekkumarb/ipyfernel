# ipyfernel 🔥


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

### Description

IPyfernel allows you to interact with a persistent remote IPython
kernel. It will stream text outputs like simple progress bar updates it
will communicate error messages seamlessly and image outputs. It allows
you to optionally “hijack” the code cell execution via “sticky” mode so
that cells execute remotely by default.

### Choice of Name

It’s a remote kernel, so this is a play on words: `ipykernel` + the
German word/prefix “fern” meaning “remote”. Plus it sounds a bit like
“infernal,” which is 🔥
